# Monte-Carlo-2D-Ising-Model
Author: Alessandro Caio and Giacomo Rizzi
Historically, the Ising model had the virtue of being the first mathematically exactly solvable model exhibiting a order-disorder phase transition [3]. Nowadays, the model is still effective in explaining and predicting magnetic properties of materials such as Cobaltate [2] and Cromium Oxide [5]. In order to overcome the limitations of the Mean Field Theory, we addressed numerically the computation of thermodynamic quantities and critical parameters by means of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. Thus, energy, magnetization, heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility per spin are computed and their temperature response is well in accordance with the expected one. Furthermore, the origin of the critical slowing down effect around the critical temperature is found to be the correlation of the spins throughout the lattice in this range. Eventually, an animation reproducing the 2D lattice occupation is performed and can be found, along with the hole code, scanning the QR-code in the “Conclusions” section.
